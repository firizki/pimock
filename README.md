# Pimock
Simple Mock API using Golang

## Requirement
- golang 1.12

## How To Use
1. Create your `response` file under directory that same with request path  
    For example you want to create mock for GET `/healthz`  
    Create file `response` under `responses/GET/healthz/`. Folder `responses` is mandatory
2. Write you header and body response HTTP inside your `response` file. The format is following [W3 HTTP/1.1 Response](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec6.html).  
    For example to send simple 200 OK you can do this
    ```
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

    OK
    ```
3. Build binary
    ```
    go build
    ```
4. Run pimock
    ```
    ./pimock
    ```
5. Access from port `8080`
    ```
    curl localhost:8080/healthz -v
    ```
